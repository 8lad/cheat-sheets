Using the base line grid approach - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGq1GllRLjk
The main idea of this approack is putting your text in the grid correctly. Each row should be on her correct place.
You can rich it by playing font size and line height.
When scale content - you should be sure, that everything is based on your grid.

Grids help align things vertical or horizontal
Grig helps things look and read better.
It's not just gtid cells, it also can be gaps between components.

Use repetition for consistancy. 
Brain loves patterns - symetry and ballance
Repetition sets the rules

The concept: 
- Our textual content sits on the grid lines (baselines) and
- We take the space between two baselines (also known as leading) and use that amount or a multiple of that amount everywhere else in our layout in terms of margins, paddings, heights, etc.

About line height:
 For good designs, it is recommend to use somewhere between 125-150% (sometimes even 170-200%) of the font size as line heights. Oh and these line heights you set, should be a multiple of the baseline grid size 

List helps to manage your rythm:
    line-height
    height (even min-height, max-height)
    margin-top, margin-bottom (or margin)
    padding-top, padding-bottom (or padding)
    top, bottom (or inset)

Good base value for rythm is 8px

horizontal rhythm:

- Letter Spacing
- Kerning 
- Text Justification – Ideally one shouldn’t. If must then use hyphenation.
Horizontal rhythm takes care of the content’s legibility (clear enough to read). That’s all we need to know for now!
