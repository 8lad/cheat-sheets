When created the main component which will wrapp the page elements (for example main with it's classes),
Inside the page you have to use React Fragment for wrapping (<></>)
Something like this

<>
  <MainWrapper>
    <h1>Other content here</h1>
    </MainWrapper>
</>

Because in other case not all your classes will work
