There are two important defenitions and tools: web driver and browser driver.
!!!! Browser driver - need to download on the machine and set the 'path' to the enviroment

There are two ways to set delay: implicitly and explicitly 

implicitly: await driver.manage().setTimeouts({implicit: 5000}); // for waiting when the element appears

explicitly: await driver.wait(until.titleIs(MAIN_PAGE_TITLE), 10000); // for waiting when the page reload or something like this
