First of all need to login or check is you're login in your npm accounts

Publishing from the build of your package folder (where is your package.json file)

For publishing should use command - 
# npm publish
If you'll have an error when publish - 
# npm ERR! code EPUBLISHCONFLICT
# npm ERR! publish fail Cannot publish over existing version.

Just try to publish without package name 
# npm publish <package name>
but just 
# npm publish

If you need to see logs about events in your package
# npm view --json

Important
Update and describe the version in the CHANGELOG file if exists
And don't forget to update the version inside the package.json file

You can have several .npmrc (npm run control)
The priority order is:
First - specific package .npmrc
Second - user .npmrc
Third - global .npmrc
