If you need to send multi line request in job, use this style

- echo "[LOG] Send request for deploying project on zeus server"

     curl
      -X POST
      -H "Content-Type:application/json"
      -d "{\"app\":\"$PROJECT_NAME\",\"targetDir\":\"$PROJECT_TARGET_DIR\"}"
      http://some-url/deploy

    - echo "[LOG] The request has been sent"
